Expertise in Financial Markets and Technology. Professional experience from both Banking Industry and Stock Exchange.
I am part of the UK Centre for Financial Computing & Analytics and Teaching Assistant of Financial and Data Analytics courses at UCL, University of London [University College London (UCL)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I am interested in data-driven innovation in the convergence of Computer Science and Finance involving Statistical Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, Complex Networks and Computational Social Science.

My work was presented at several international academic and business conferences and it was cited at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/important-study-confirms-non-linear-evidence-of-causal-effects-of-social-media-on-market-prices-using-psychsignal-dataset), US-based company [PsychSignal](https://psychsignal.com/uclwhitepapers/) and at Twitter's official [Blog](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/twitter-data-and-the-financial-markets-sentiment-analysis-volatility-other-indicators).
