Expertise in Financial Markets and Technology. Professional experience from both Banking Industry and Stock Exchange. Academic background in Computer Science (B.Sc, M.Sc, Ph.D candidate). I'm part of the Research Group in [Financial Computing and Analytics](http://fincomp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) of the [University College London (UCL)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I am interested in disruptive data-driven solutions in the intersection of Computer Science and Finance involving Statistical Computing, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computational Social Science.

My work was presented at several international academic and business conferences and it was cited at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/important-study-confirms-non-linear-evidence-of-causal-effects-of-social-media-on-market-prices-using-psychsignal-dataset), US-based company [PsychSignal](https://psychsignal.com/uclwhitepapers/) and at Twitter's official [Blog](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/twitter-data-and-the-financial-markets-sentiment-analysis-volatility-other-indicators).
